["Self-Portrait Sketch"](https://alexanderlik.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

# Homework #4

This week, I made my first complete p5 composition using all of the basic shape and color functions. It was fun to be able to think creatively and find ways to express various body parts artistically using rudimentary shapes, which were themselves constructed using code and numbers. It definitely took a while to get used to the idea of drawing shapes and lines using co-ordinates, and I definitely spent a lot of time constantly experimenting and re-adjusting the points.

I decided to make a kind of self-portrait that reflected my interior self more than my physical appearance. Instead of being caught up on the details of my anatomy I was able to use the highly-reconfigurable nature of the p5 shapes to make more interesting representations. I was definitely inspired by ["the arc documentation page"](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/arc) when I designed the eyes.

The biggest difficulty for me was not letting myself be too much of a perfectionist and worrying over the details.
