["Goodbye Cruel World!" Sketch](https://alexanderlik.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

# Homework #3

This week, I learned how to execute some basic p5 functions, as well as get an extremely brief introduction to the structure of online code and how `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, and `p5.js` operate together in order to deliver content to a web browser. I was even able to create a rudimentary `sketch.js` file using the `setup()`, `createCanvas()`, `background()`, `draw()`, and `text()` functions!

I've written a few "Hello World" programs before so I decided - in what must be the most groundbreaking and edgy artistic statement ever to grace the Media Arts department - to have my program print `Goodbye cruel world!` instead. It is accompanied with a somber `aquamarine` background to express the serious tone of the piece. I found the color by going through [this list of HTML colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) which is far more exhaustive than I imagined - who needs Hex codes anymore? Definitely a page I'm going to bookmark.

Overall I found this week's course material to be easy to understand and work through - but I've taken three separate Computer Science classes in my life, including one specifically focused on `HTML` and `JavaScript`, so I would be lying if I said none of this material is review.
