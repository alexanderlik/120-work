## Responses
1. This week I learned how to:
  * Understand the difference between types of text files such as `.txt`, `.doc`, and `.md`;
  * Use various text editors such as Notepad, Atom, and Brackets;
  * Understand the structure and purpose non-destructive Git file management systems;
  * Use a Git GUI such as GitHub Desktop to create a repository and upload it to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com/);
  * Write a file (this one) using Markdown!
2. After meeting with Michael in person (which was super helpful and made me feel a lot more confident!) I was able to simply go over the material on the website again and complete it without too much difficulty.
3. So far I have not had many issues - again, I went over a lot of the assignment with Michael beforehand so there wasn't much for me to post to the issue tracker.
4. After that 30-minute talking-head, self-congratulatory video "tutorial" about PowerShell I feel like I learned very little about it, how to use it, and especially how it differs from the Command Prompt, so I'd love to learn more about that. Or maybe I just fell asleep 10 minutes into the video...
5. Unfortunately I have been so behind that I haven't had a chance to look at the issues on GitHub yet! `:'(` But hopefully I will catch up and be able to stay more involved with the class!

Finally, here's a screenshot of this file! How meta!
